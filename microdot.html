            <p class="microp">In numerous economies, people make loans with a high interest rate. They find themselves unable to pay back these 
            loans and thus fall increasingly into debt, causing inflation to soar. To solve this problem, we created MicroDot: a digital currency 
            that decays over time. With a negative interest rate and a currency that loses value, people would be incentivized to spend money 
            faster and thus stimulate the economy.</p>
            <p>My goal was to create a user interface for users to make transactions and trade products using our currency. This would encourage 
            spending and stimulate a lagging economy.</p>
            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <ul class="mdul">
                <li class="prob">Money has a positive interest rate that accumulates over time</li><br>
                <li class="prob">Debt easily accumulates over time</li>
                <li class="prob">Central banks feel the need to artificially adjust interest rates</li>
            </ul><br><br><br>
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            To solve these problems, we asked ourselves a question: 
            <br><br>
            <b class="soln">How could we create a marketplace to incentivize spending in failing economies?</b>
            <p>By creating a digital currency that decayed over time.</p>
            <h5>Research</h5>
            <h6>Functional-related</h6>
            <p>We explored several other functional solutions that attempted to address our problems, mostly revolving around digital currencies. 
            However, we found that they often had their own problems, which included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Instability of values</b></li><br>
                <p>The value of Bitcoin has gone from zero to nearly $20,000 for one Bitcoin in December 2017. However, in July 2018 it was valued
                at only $6K a Bitcoin which is a lot lower than what it used to be. Its value probably would keep on dropping. These wild changes
                in value increase the risk of using cryptocurrency since there could be huge loss involved.
                <li><b>Lack of Acceptance</b></li><br>
                <p>Businesses fear the constant changes in value that cryptocurrency has and are reluctant to accept it as a form of payment. 
                Cryptocurrency is also not legal tender in the US, so businesses are less likely to accept it. Foreign countries also share the 
                same sentiment.</p>
                <li><b>Transaction Errors</b></li><br>
                <p>Humans have a tendency to make mistakes by recording numbers wrong, mistakes that are not necessarily always caught. A wrong 
                    number can be detrimental to someone's personal data.</p>
                <li><b>Theft</b></li><br>
                <p>Despite encryption to protect cryptocurrency transactions, there have been hacks resulting in substantial losses. Passwords 
                    can be stolen or hacked, hardware corrupted or taken, and security breaches with other businesses. Thus there could be losses 
                    here as well.</p>
            </ul>
            
            <h6>Design-related</h6>
            <p>We also wanted to include aspects of both Venmo transactions as well as an Amazon marketplace. To do this, we evaluated the pain
                points of people who use these apps.

            Pain points of Venmo:
                <li>1% fee for immediate transfer to bank account</li><br>
                <li>Charging or clearing multiple requests at once</li><br>
                <li>Easy to mix up Send and Request buttons</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
                
            </ul>
            <h6>Target Audience</h6>
            <p>We also evaluated our target audience:
            We realized that most of our target audience was people in lagging economies who still had access to decently advanced technology,
                since their economies suffered from runaway inflation and high debt rates but their countries weren't necessarily poor. We reached
                out to the Puerto Rican government as one of our target members:

                We also contacted a small town in West Virginia.</p>
            <h5>Explorations</h5>
            <h6>Design Idea</h6>
            <p>Before sketching out designs, I created a user flow for the user's expected journey through the prototype to encourage the user
                to access these pages in this particular manner.<br>
                <img src="images/userflowmicrodot.jpg" class="userflow" alt="Name Logo"><br>
                
                <p>We knew that digital currencies have a more economic, mechanical feel, so we decided on blocker text and figures, as well as a 
                black/red color scheme.<br><br>
            
                We tried to model our webpages after Amazon, Kickstarter, and Venmo, since we were combining their functionalities for our 
                digital currency on our site:</p>

                <h6>The Marketplace for Products in Amazon:</h6>
                <img src="images/amazonscreenshot.jpg" class="model" alt="Name Logo">

                <h6>Low-fi modeled after Amazon:</h6>
                <p>We liked the search bar on top for looking for products of interest, as well as the bar on the left side for more details 
                about a user's search results. We also liked the list of cards describing each product.</p>
                <img src="images/lowfiamazon.png" class="model" alt="Name Logo"><hr>

                <h6>The Marketplace for Companies in Kickstarter:</h6>
                <img src="images/kickstartersite.png" class="model" alt="Name Logo">

                <h6>Low-fi modeled after Kickstarter:</h6>
                <p>We adopted the list of cards idea for our design.</p>
                <img src="images/kickstarter.png" class="model" alt="Name Logo"><hr>

                <h6>Transactions in Venmo:</h6>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="images/venmopayrequest.png" class="venmo" alt="Name Logo">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="images/venmopersonal.png" class="venmo" alt="Name Logo">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p class="h8"></p>
            <h5>Design</h5>
            <p class="h7">We started with the first interfaces and information that users would see:</p>
            <h6>Part 1: Login page</h6>
            <img src="images/Log-in Page.jpg" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <h6>Part 2: Sign-up page</h6>
            <img src="images/Sign-up Page.jpg" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <h6>Part 3: Home page</h6>
            <img src="images/home.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo"><hr>
            <p class="h6">Interacting with other users:</p>
            <h6>Part 4: Investment page</h6>
            <img src="images/invest.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <h6>Part 5: Marketplace page</h6>
            <img src="images/market.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo"><hr>
            <h6>Part 7: Product/Company Details:</h6>
            <img src="images/companyprof.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <img src="images/marketitem.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo"><hr>
            <p class="h6">Diving more deeply into the individual user's functions, we dealt with people's transactions:</p>
            <h6>Part 6: My Wallet</h6>
            <img src="images/wallet.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <h6>Part 7: Sending money</h6>
            <img src="images/send.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <img src="images/send2.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <img src="images/confirm.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
    

            <h5>Final Coded Solution</h5>
            <p>Using HTML and CSS, we coded up the website on VS Code. We did our best to stick with our design:</p>
            <img src="images/microdotabout.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <img src="images/microdotsignup.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <img src="images/microdotlogin1.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <img src="images/microdotlogin2.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <img src="images/microdotinvest.png" class="micrologin" alt="Name Logo">
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>This was my first time using Figma, so it was interesting learning the ropes on how to design. I thought my co-intern and I did a good
            job designing and coding up the website but I wish we got farther along with website content and started working on the back-end of 
            the marketplace. On the product design side, I wish we played a bigger role in cold calling and contacting customers for their pain
            points instead of rushing into the design early on. I also wish we explored more explorations in low, med, and high-fidelity and done
            more user testing to visualize the user flow of customers.<br><br>
            Along the way, I had my first experience working throughout business hours with a team of people. I appreciate how close I grew to my
            coworkers and the friendships I formed. Overall, I am grateful for both the teamwork experience I gained and the introduction to 
            product design. I look forward to gaining more experience in the future!</p>
